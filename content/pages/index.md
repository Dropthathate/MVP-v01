    subtitle: Four simple steps to transform your clinical documentation
    text: >
      **1. Speak Naturally During Assessment**


      Simply verbalize your observations as you work: "Mark restricted right upper trapezius," "anterior pelvic tilt," or "elevated left scapula." SomaSync listens through your smartphone or in-ear device.


      **2. AI-Powered Recognition**


      Our advanced Natural Language Processing engine detects trigger words, identifies anatomical structures (muscles, joints, tendons, nerves), maps deviations and asymmetries, captures laterality automatically, and time-stamps every observation.


      **3. Real-Time Insights**


      SomaSync provides confirmation of captured findings, supportive prompts to ensure complete documentation, pattern recognition suggestions, and context-aware clinical insights.


      **4. Structured SOAP Notes**


      At the end of your session, SomaSync automatically generates a complete, structured SOAP note ready for your EHR system, billing, or client records.

      **The SomaSphere: Collaborative Insight Engine**


      Transform individual assessments into community-powered wisdom. After identifying a deviation like "anterior pelvic tilt," tap the SomaSphere icon to access interactive 3D anatomical models, heat maps showing prevalence of similar patterns across anonymized demographics, population-level musculoskeletal health trends, and context for understanding if your client's issue is part of a broader pattern.


      **SyncLearn Modules: Just-in-Time Education**


      Turn every session into a learning opportunity. When SomaSync suggests a pattern like "Upper Crossed Syndrome," a Learn icon appears. Tap it to access 30-90 second tutorial videos, interactive anatomical diagrams, specific palpation technique demonstrations, TCM pattern explanations, and muscle group visualizations.

      color: text-dark
      type: TitleBlock
    text: >
      **Q: Do I need special equipment?**

      A: No. SomaSync works with your smartphone's built-in microphone. For hands-free operation, any Bluetooth earbud works. We'll also offer a recommended in-ear device for optimal performance.


      **Q: How accurate is the speech recognition?**

      A: Our system is trained specifically on clinical language and achieves over 80% accuracy in controlled tests. It continues to learn and improve with use.


      **Q: Is my client data secure?**

      A: Absolutely. We're building SomaSync with HIPAA compliance as a core requirement. All data is encrypted and you maintain full control over your records.


      **Q: Can I edit the AI-generated notes?**

      A: Yes. SomaSync generates draft notes that you can review, edit, and approve before finalizing.


      **Q: Does it integrate with my existing practice management software?**

      A: Phase I focuses on copy-to-clipboard functionality. Phase II will include direct integrations with major EHR and practice management systems.


      **Q: What if the AI doesn't understand what I say?**

      A: You can always review the transcription in real-time and provide corrections. The system learns from these corrections to improve accuracy.


      **Q: Do I need internet connection?**

      A: For the MVP, yes. Future versions will include offline mode with sync when reconnected.


      **Q: What languages are supported?**

      A: Phase I supports English. Additional languages will be added based on user demand.
